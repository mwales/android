## Android Stuff

Collection of applications I write as I work on Android stuff while reading the Big Nerd Ranch
Android book.  Want a git repo to back stuff up to incase I bork something.  Git Hub is like a
free backup for source I dont need to keep private.

Image files contained within were just grabbed from wherever I found them.  Look up the licensing
on them seperately.  As if anyone will ever actually read this, or reuse my shitty code...

Also nice using git because Android tools work well with it, not set up as nice for SVN.
